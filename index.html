<!--Replace the project title and provide a flashy subtitle. Developers refer to this division as a "Hero Block." You don't need to do anything in this html. code, but you'll need to change the background image on the style.css page. First replace the el1.jpg with a .jpg or .png in the project folder (hint: simplify the name). Then use your text editor to open your style.css sheet, find the hero image, and replace el1.jpg with the name of your new image-->

  <h2>What are we making?</h2>
  
    <h3>Programmers who want to learn more about C/C++ build tools will be disappointed by the lack of easy-to-use online resources. Existing material is too technical, unclear, or incomplete. To solve this problem, we propose the creation of a user-friendly C/C++ Build Tools Guide.</h3>

<!--Add more photos to your project folder for a photo grid, making sure the files end in .jpg or .png and replace/add to the names on the grid below on this html file. You can add more images if you wish, or subtract...see what happens--you have to be playful to find out how things work.-->

    <h2>What does this mean?</h2>

    <h3>Build tools include compilers, linkers, assemblers, and other automation tools. Together, these convert source code into a deliverable package, which may be an application for end users or a software module for other programmers. Our C/C++ Build Tools Guide will include instructions for choosing and using compilers, build systems, and other tools appropriately and effectively.</h3>

    <!--Replace the image here. You can also control image width and height %.-->

  <h2>Why does this matter?</h2>
  
     <h3>C/C++ build tools improve programmersâ€™ productivity and overall experience. With this guide, programmers will avoid wasting time and energy writing unnecessary code or scouring for resources online.</h3>

  <h2>What's our plan?</h2>

    <h3>Our team consists of six people with different programming backgrounds and experiences; we will incorporate both depth and generalizability for the various needs of our audience. Over the next two weeks, we will research build tools, organize information, and revise content for maximum comprehensibility.</h3>
